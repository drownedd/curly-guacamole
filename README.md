Project done following the tutorial of [GamesWithGabe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQP4qSCj1eHMHisDDR4iPzw) at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=025QFeZfeyM&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)'s YouTube channel.

None of the code is mine, I just followed the tutorial and added some comments to help me understand the code.

What will we be learning?

- [x] LWJGL (lightweight java game library)
- [x] OpenGL/GLFW
- [x] Shaders, Meshes, Batching
- [x] Animation System (Finite State Automata)
- [x] Physics, Collision Detection, Collision Resolution

Finally, creating a game using the built engine!
